# The portfolio of Justin Wallace

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Typescript**
- **NextJS**
- **Styled Components**
- **DatoCMS**
- **Graphql**

## Features

1. **Atoms**: These are a code implementation of a design system. Values can be replaced easily and used across the
   project via quarks
2. **Quarks**: These are essentially fully-featured [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) that implement
   atom values via React props.
3. **Molecules**: These are small React components mostly built using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) but heavily
   manipulated.
4. **Linting**: Fully fleshed out [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) rule sets are
   included which run on each commit via [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and
   [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged).
5. **Type-safety**: This portfolio takes full advantage of Typescript for easy debugging, scalability, and (of course)
   portfolio purposes.
