# Brand Button

These buttons are useful for log in and sign up screens and actions.

## Usage

<br />

The `BrandButton` is built using the `Button` molecule and therefore has the same capabilities.

It can be used anywhere you can use `Button`.

## Props

<br />

### brandColor and brandTextColor

The `brandColor` and `brandTextColor` props allow the `BrandButton` to take any valid CSS color value, including hex,
rgba, or hsl. `brandColor` changes the background color of the button, while `brandTextColor` changes the color of the
text on the button. If the color of the `startIcon` or `icon` can be altered with `textColor`, then `brandTextColor`
will change their colors as well.

As the regular `Button` molecule can only take `backgroundColor` and `textColor` values defined in the UI Library's
`Color` atom, this makes `BrandButton` ideal if you want to utilize brand-specific colors.

You can see how both props are utilized in the example code below:

```
  <BrandButton
    startIcon={<FaFacebook />}
    variant="contained"
    brandColor="#1877f2"
    brandTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    marginBottom={16}
  >
    Sign in with Facebook
  </BrandButton>
```

`backgroundColor` and `textColor` can still be used on `BrandButton` if you want to utilize any of the colors defined in
the `Color` atom.

### Variants

`BrandButton` works well with the `contained` and `outline` variants available on the `Button` molecule. On the Canvas
tab and down below, you can find examples of both variants.

### Icon only

If you want to create an Icon Only button, simply pass an `icon` as the child to `BrandButton`. See the example code
below:

```
  <BrandButton
    variant="contained"
    brandColor="#1877f2"
    brandTextColor="#FFFFFF"
    paddingX={8}
    marginBottom={16}
  >
    <FaFacebook size="24px" />
  </BrandButton>
```

`startIcon` should only be used when you want an icon leading text you have on your button.

### Disabled

The `disabled` prop works as it does on `Button`. When it comes to `icons`, the effect `disabled={true}` has on the
color of the `icon` will vary depending on the source of the `icon`. On the Canvas tab and below, you can see the effect
it has on `icons` being imported from `react-icons/fa`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Brand" story={stories.brand} />
</Canvas>

### Additional Props

Refer to the documentation on `Button` for a full list of available props.
