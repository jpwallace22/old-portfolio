## Usage

Carousel is a wrapper that takes its children and creates a Carousel with them. By default, `autoPlay` is off and the
`interval` is 6 seconds between transitions when on.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Carousel" story={stories.CarouselStory} />
</Canvas>

### Props

<ArgsTable story="Carousel" />
