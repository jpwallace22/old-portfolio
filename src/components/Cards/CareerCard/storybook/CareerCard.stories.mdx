# Career Card

A standard card comprised of a heading, subhead, details, and CTA button. Subhead, details, and the button are optional
for the most amout of flexibility possible. (If heading is not desired, use the
[BasicCard](?path=/story/components-cards-basic-card--basic-card) component)

## Usage

#### Button Props

The Button within the card can be manipulated with a number of basic Button props. `endIcon` and `startIcon` will add
Icons to the beginning and end of the button, with `iconSize` determining the size of them. Additionally, `href`
controls the destination of the button and `onClick` can be used for any event actions. Lastly, `buttonText` will
control the CTA text and `hideButton` can be used to hide the button.

#### Heading, subhead, and details

The `heading`, `subhead`, and `details` can be set with the cooresponding props. Subhead and details optional and
leaving them out will collapse the card on its location.
