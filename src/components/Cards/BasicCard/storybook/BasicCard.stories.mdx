# Basic Card

A standard card comprised of a heading, subhead, and CTA button. All three are optional for the most amout of
flexibility possible.

## Usage

#### Size

The `BasicCard` has two sizes (sm & lg) controlled by the `size` prop, and is a default of large.

#### Button Props

The Button within the card can be manipulated with a number of basic Button props. `endIcon` and `startIcon` will add
Icons to the beginning and end of the button, with `iconSize` determining the size of them. Additionally, `href`
controls the destination of the button and `onClick` can be used for any event actions. Lastly, if neither a `href` or
`onlClick` are provided, no button will be rendered.

#### Heading & subhead

The `heading` and `subhead` can be set with the cooresponding props. Both are optional and leaving them out will
collapse the card on its location.
